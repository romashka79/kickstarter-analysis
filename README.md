# Kickstarting with Excel

Data Analysis of the play fundraising campaigns based on the correlation of campaignsâ€™ launch dates and fundraising goals as recorded in the Kickstarter dataset.  

### Purpose

Analysis and visual feedback of the Kickstarter campaign outcomes based on the launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

A pivot table and a line chart were created based on the number of theater campaigns and their respective launch dates obtained from the Parent Category and Years columns in the Kickstarter dataset. Based on the data displayed in the pivot table and reflected on the line chart, we can conclude that the theater campaigns launched during May and June have a higher chance to succeed and reach their fundraising goals, then the campaigns launched the rest of the year.
