# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Data Analysis of the play fundraising campaigns based on the correlation of campaigns’ launch dates and fundraising goals as recorded in the Kickstarter dataset.  

### Purpose

Analysis and visual feedback of the Kickstarter campaign outcomes based on the launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

A pivot table and a line chart were created based on the number of theater campaigns and their respective launch dates obtained from the Parent Category and Years columns in the Kickstarter dataset. Based on the data displayed in the pivot table and reflected on the line chart, we can conclude that the theater campaigns launched during May and June have a higher chance to succeed and reach their fundraising goals, then the campaigns launched the rest of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

A line chart, Outcomes Based on Goals, was created based on the data derived from the funding goal amounts for the campaigns in the ‘play’ subcategory. Based on the visual information presented in the chart below, we can conclude that there a correlation between the fundraising goal amount and the campaign outcome. The analysis of the chart shows the higher the campaign’s funding goal is, the less likely it is to have a successful outcome. In other words, if the people are required to give less money, they are more willing to participate.
