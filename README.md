# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Data Analysis of the play fundraising campaigns based on the correlation of campaignsâ€™ launch dates and fundraising goals as recorded in the Kickstarter dataset.  

### Purpose

Analysis and visual feedback of the Kickstarter campaign outcomes based on the launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

A pivot table and a line graph were created based on the number of theater campaigns and their respective launch dates obtained from the Parent Category and Years columns. Based on the data displayed in the pivot chart and reflected in the line graph, we can conclude that Louis would have a higher chance of a successful campaign and reaching her fundraising goal, if the campaign is launched during the months of May and June.
